1.Assume a priority queue is implemented using a max heap. Show the contents of the max heap array that results from enqueuing (inserting) the following integer priorities:
5, 43, 19, 26, 72, 33, 9, 21, 88
Assume the initial array size is 10 elements.

| x | 88 | 72 | 33 | 42 | 26 | 19 | 9 | 5 | 21 |

2.Assume a priority queue is implemented using a min heap and the following shows the contents of the array (assume the first item is at index 1).
4, 21, 8, 25, 42, 16, 33, 57, 73
Show the resulting min heap array after two dequeue (removeMin) operations are done.

| x | 16 | 21 | 33 | 25 | 42 | 73 | 57 |  |  |
