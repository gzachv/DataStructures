1. All parts of this question refer to standard binary search trees. The next question will deal with red-black trees, but for this question assume you are using simple binary search trees with no extra balancing code. The answers in your text file should look like:

             20        <-- root node value
          /      \     <-- edges (links)
         13      33    <-- level 2 node values
        /  \    /  \   <-- edges (links)
       8   14  25  47  <-- level 3 node values
Part A: Show the binary search tree that results from inserting the following sequence of integers into a tree that is initially empty:

  11   22   33   44   99   88   77   66   55

		
		11
	           \
		     22
			\
			  33
			    \
			     44
			        \
				  99
				/
			      88				
			     /
			   77
			  /						
			66
		       /
		     55


Part B: Show the binary search tree that results from inserting the following sequence of integers into a tree that is initially empty:

  22   77   55   66   33   88   11   44   99

				22
			      /    \
			    11      77
				   /  \
				 55    88
			       /    \    \
			     33      66	   99
				\
				  44


Part C: Show the binary search tree that results from deleting 22 from the tree in part B using the in-order successor.
						
				33
			      /    \
			    11      77
				   /  \
				 55    88
			       /    \    \
			     44      66	   99
				
				  


Part D: Show the binary search tree that results from deleting 77 from the tree in part B using the in-order predecessor.

				22
			      /    \
			    11      66
				   /  \
				 55    88
			       /         \
			     33      	   99
				\
				  44


2. All parts of this question refer to red-black tree. In your text file, indicate red nodes by using square brackets around the value (e.g., [44]) and indicate black nodes by not using any brackets around the value (e.g., 44).

Part A: Show the red-black tree that results from inserting the following sequence of integers into a tree that is initially empty:

  11   22   33   44   99   88   77   66   55


	     44        
          /      \     
        [22]     [88]    
        /  \      /  \   
      11    33   66   99
		/ \
	     [55]  [77]	 
					



Part B: Show the red-black tree that results from inserting the following sequence of integers into a tree that is initially empty:

  22   77   55   66   33   88   11   44   99


    	     55        
          /      \     
        [22]      [77]    
        /  \      /  \   
      11    33   66   88
	      \		\
	     [44]	 [99]
